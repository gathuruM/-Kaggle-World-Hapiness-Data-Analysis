This report ranks 155 countries by their happiness level through 6 indicators:

- economic production
- social support
- life expectancy 
- freedom 
- absence of corruption
- generosity

The last indicator is dystopia residual. Dystopia residual is "the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country".  Dystopia is a made up country that has the world's least happiest people. This made up country is high in corruption, low in average income, employment, etc. Dystopia residual is used as a benchmark and should be used side-by-side with the happiness score.
